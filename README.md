# Variable Claims
 This is a variable claim model that I have made to measure policy cost as a PDF/PMF. This assumes that there is a Poisson distribution of number of claims per a client for a period of time with an exponential distribution of cost. This model takes into account a policy limit, policy deductible and policy rate for the expenses. 
The Folder Variable-Claims/Variable_Claims_Model/
contains all of the files made plus a pdf that explains the mathematics of the model.
